# NeuroHCI Meetup 2026

Welcome to the official repository for the **NeuroHCI Meetup @ CHI 2026** website. This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## 📅 Event Details

- **Title:** NeuroHCI: Integrating Neuroscience and Human-Computer Interaction
- **Date:** April 13-17, 2026
- **Location:** Barcelona, Spain (In conjunction with CHI '26)
- **Time:** Session Time TBD

## 🌟 Overview

Advances in performance and accessibility of methods such as EEG, fNIRS, BCIs, and biosensing open new possibilities for design and interaction while also raising conceptual, technical, and ethical challenges. This meet-up brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the timely intersection of neuroscience and human–computer interaction (NeuroHCI).

Our goal is to catalyze interdisciplinary collaboration, strengthen and grow the NeuroHCI community, and identify promising directions for future research and practice.
