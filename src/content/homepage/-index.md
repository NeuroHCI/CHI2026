overview:
  title: "About the Meet-up"
  content: "This meet-up will bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the timely intersection of neuroscience and human–computer interaction (NeuroHCI). Advances in performance and accessibility of methods such as EEG, fNIRS, BCIs, and biosensing open new possibilities for design and interaction while also raising conceptual, technical, and ethical challenges. The session will employ engaging, interactive activities to maximize dialog, including an exercise that invites participants to experience embodied approaches to interaction. Our goal is to catalyze interdisciplinary collaboration, strengthen and grow the NeuroHCI community, and identify promising directions for future research and practice."

  description: "Informal Schedule of Activities"
  items:
    - time: "0-10 min"
      title: "Welcome & Pin Ice-breaker"
      # speaker: "Organizers"
      description: "Organizers will welcome each participant and let them pick pins to add to their lapel based on their personal interests (e.g., EEG, fNIRS, Soma design, Well-being). These pins serve as prompts to spark conversation among strangers."
    - time: "10-50 min"
      title: "“Mix the neurons” Networking"
      # speaker: "All"
      description: "A speed-dating style rotation where organizers present open-ended prompts, such as 'everyone with a wearable pin should talk to someone with a well-being pin.' This encourages unexpected discussions between people who wouldn't necessarily have networked."
    - time: "50-80 min"
      title: "Body-mind Activity"
      # speaker: "Kristina Höök"
      description: "An exercise aimed at initially turning attention inward towards the body and then socially toward others using a haptic technology. This provides firsthand experience with soma-based design methods, broadening the scope of discussion beyond typical brain-centric concepts to embodied ones."
    - time: "80-90 min"
      title: "Wrap-up"
      # speaker: "Organizers"
      description: "Closing remarks, summary of the session's insights, and a call-to-action for follow-up activities, enabling the community to stay connected."

      bio: "Yudai Tanaka is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago advised by Prof. Pedro Lopes. In his research, Yudai explores computer interfaces that output sensory feedback by intercepting the user’s brain or nervous system. These interfaces free up the user’s body from hardware in touch interactions, or even envision a new form of interactive experiences by presenting sensations directly to the brain. Yudai has published work at top HCI conferences including ACM CHI/UIST, with Best Paper Award (CHI 2023), Best Paper Honorable Mention (CHI 2024, UIST 2024), and Best Demo Award (CHI 2022) & Honorable Mention (UIST 2024). His work has been covered by IEEE Spectrum and New Scientist."

      bio: "Kristina \"Kia\" Höök is a Professor in Interaction Design at the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in Stockholm, Sweden. Kia focuses on Soma Design -- a design stance that merges a naturalistic and feminist cultural position on bodies with somaesthetics. Somaesthetics is a pragmatist philosophical concept, combining soma (uniting body, emotion and mind) with aesthetics (our ability to change our somas in the aesthetic and ethical direction we want to change). The Soma Design framework translates these theories into design methods for fostering perceptual awareness and bodily engagement in iterative co-design workshops and techniques like defamiliarization, helping participants reconnect with bodily knowledge for researching new interactive technologies. Soma Design’s core aesthetic and ethical commitment, felt ethics, centres on honouring human dignity and somatic freedoms."

      bio: "Pedro Lopes is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Pedro focuses on integrating interfaces with the human body—exploring the interface paradigm that supersedes wearables. Examples of these new interfaces include muscle stimulation wearables that allow users to manipulate tools they have never seen before or that accelerate reaction time, or a device that leverages the smell to create an illusion of temperature. These interactive devices leverage computers to augment the user’s body, not just cognitively, but also physically. Most recently, Pedro is exploring how interfaces can provide assistance and promote attitude change with regards to critical societal challenges, such as reducing electronic waste. Pedro’s work has received several academic awards, such as CHI/UIST Best Papers, the Sloan Fellowship, and the NSF CAREER award."
